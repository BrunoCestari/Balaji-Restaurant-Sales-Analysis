## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements
1. **Total Revenue**: Calculated as the sum of the total price of all product orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: Calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Product Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all products sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Product Per Order**: Calculated by dividing the total number of products sold by the total number of orders.
6. **Percentage of 'Not Available' Transactions**: Investigate occurrences of 'Not Available' transactions and their impact on revenue.
7. **Total Amount of 'Not Available' Transaction Type**: Analyze the total transaction amount associated with 'Not Available' transaction types.

## Charts Requirement
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: Bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: Line chart illustrating the monthly trend for total orders over a specific time period.
3. **Hourly Trend for Total Orders**: Line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
4. **Total Products Sold by Name**: Bar chart showing the distribution of sales across different product names.
5. **Total Orders by Product Name**: Tree map or donut chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different product sizes.
6. **Percentage of Sales by Product Name**: Funnel chart presenting the total number of products sold for each category.
7. **Total Orders and Revenue by Transaction Type**: Insights into 'Not Available' transactions and their contribution to total revenue.
8. **Total Revenue by Gender**: Analysis of spending behaviors and revenue generated by different genders.
9. **Favorite Products by Gender**: Insights into consumer preferences among males and females.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data underwent a comprehensive cleaning and transformation process to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. The following steps were taken:

### Date Standardization and Extraction
The date column initially contained two possible formats: "dd-mm-yy" and "dd/mm/yy". To standardize the format and facilitate analysis, all dates were converted to the "dd-mm-yy" format and then converted from string to date data type. Additionally, the day and month names were extracted from the standardized date and stored in separate columns named `day_name` and `month_name`, respectively.

### Transaction Type Imputation
Blank values in the transaction type column were replaced with the string 'Not Available'. The transaction type column now includes three possibilities: 'Online', 'Cash', and 'Not Available'. The occurrence of 'Not Available' transactions can be attributed to various factors, including canceled transactions, system errors, manual data entry errors, unidentified payment methods, free items or services, in-store credits or returns, incomplete transactions, refunds or reversals, non-monetary transactions, people leaving without paying, and donations. Investigating these occurrences is essential for optimizing operations and minimizing losses.

### Gender Transformation
The column `received_by` was renamed to `gender`, and the values 'Mr' and 'Mrs' were transformed to 'Male' and 'Female', respectively. This transformation provides clearer gender identification for analysis purposes.

### Time of Sale Transformation
The categorical values representing different times of sale ('Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Night', and 'Midnight') were remapped to numerical values representing specific hours. This transformation enables more granular analysis of sales trends throughout the day. For instance, 'Morning' is represented by '08:00', 'Afternoon' by '13:00', and so forth. These transformations were performed using SQL queries, allowing for consistency and reproducibility in the analysis process.

The SQL view `transformed_sales_view` encapsulates all these transformations, providing a structured and clean dataset ready for further analysis and visualization.


## Files

Two SQL files are provided:

1. **transformed_sales_view.sql**: Contains the query to create the `transformed_sales_view` view, which includes all data transformations.
   
2. **analysis.sql**: Contains queries for further data analysis and insights generation.

The `transformed_sales_view` view can be directly imported into Power BI for visualization and analysis. This integration streamlines the process of leveraging SQL transformations in Power BI for creating reports and dashboards.

The document `queries_document.pdf` has been added to showcase all the outputs of each SQL query.
